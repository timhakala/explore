git branch -f master HEAD && git checkout master 
 -- assuming your goal is to keep your current head but to designate it as master

or

git branch -f master temp
git checkout master
(these two commands can be abbreviated as git checkout -B master temp)

You can then delete the temporary branch:
git branch -d temp

Finally, you will probably want to push the reestablished history:
git push origin master

or

To get back on a master branch, while keeping the changes, try the following commands:
git rebase HEAD master
git checkout master

or

If you are completely sure HEAD is the good state:
git branch -f master HEAD
git checkout master

You probably can't push to origin, since your master has diverged from origin. If you are sure no one else is using the repo, you can force-push:
git push -f

Most useful if you are on a feature branch no one else is using.

************
just do 
git checkout master

git branch 
to confirm your branch.

or
delete the local branch again, since I didn't have any local commits that I wanted to push:
git branch -d branchname
and then checking the branch out again
git checkout branchname
